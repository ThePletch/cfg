# Web-based Installers

There isn't a way to install these packages via a package manager or CLI (that I know of), so this is just a list of links to install them manually.

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), for text editing.
	* [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) to install Sublime dependencies. Recommmended packages:
		* SublimeLinter (framework for auto-linting code)
		* SublimeLinter-flake8 (plugin to auto-lint Python code with flake8)
